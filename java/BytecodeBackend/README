Java1.4Backend - Version R20060915

The Java1.4Backend is an extension of the Java1.4Frontend to form a full Java
compiler, generating Java bytecode. The compiler is reasonably fast: around 4
times slower than javac. The backend is not as thoroughly tested as the
frontend, but the compiler can nevertheless handle large programs, and has,
e.g., been used for successfully compiling itself.

A main program JavaCompiler is included that parses Java source code,
performs static-semantic checking and generated .class files.

BUILDING

This module depends on the Java1.4Frontend available at http://jastadd.cs.lth.se.
All tools needed (jastadd2, jflex, beaver, etc.) are included. You only need to
have javac and ant installed in order to continue. An example ant build file is
included. 

RUNNING

Usage: java JavaCompiler <options> <source files>
  -verbose                  Output messages about what the compiler is doing
  -classpath <path>         Specify where to find user class files
  -sourcepath <path>        Specify where to find input source files
  -bootclasspath <path>     Override location of bootstrap class files
  -extdirs <dirs>           Override location of installed extensions
  -d <directory>            Specify where to place generated class files
  -help                     Print a synopsis of standard options
  -version                  Print version information
