Java1.5Frontend - Version R20060915

The Java1.5Frontend is an extension of the Java1.4Frontend and implements the
language extensions in Java 1.5, including generics, the extended for
statement, and static imports. The implementation is experimental and tested on
only small examples. An experimental backend is also included, extending the
Java1.4Backend.

A main program JavaCompiler is included that parses Java source code,
performs static-semantic checking and generated .class files.

BUILDING

This module depends on the Java1.4Frontend available at http://jastadd.cs.lth.se.
This module depends on the BytecodeBackend available at http://jastadd.cs.lth.se.
All tools needed (jastadd2, jflex, beaver, etc.) are included. You only need to
have javac and ant installed in order to continue. An example ant build file is
included.
